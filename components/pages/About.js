        Hi, my name is Jared. I'm a native of International Falls. In October of
        2020, my wife and I welcomed our first baby into the world, a little
        girl named Baylor. It's been amazing watching her learn and grow. I was
        a Hardware Server Engineer for the past 8 years and feel I have gone as
        far as I can go in that field. I am now enrolled in the University of
        Denver Coding Boot Camp. This has taught me not only automation but also
        the Full Stack Development. I am now ready to accept a position that
        will be either front-end, back-end or a fullstack website! Please visit
        my LinkedIn to connect with me or my Github to view all of my projects
        that I have worked on.
      </p>
